            <p class="information"> This website (in reality) is a school/personal project dedicated to the development of a information page for a fictional character I have made known as Xandjur, an Illusionist who specializes in reclaiming/collecting swords for buyers across the Xel Dynasty.</p>

            <h2>What is an Illusionist?</h2>
            <p>Illusionist, more commonly known as Illusionaries, are freelance bounty hunters who work in the field of retrieving high-priced or valuable items, vessels, tools or weaponry of interest. In short, they work on securing an item or vehicle of the buyer/government's order, salvage if not repair the item of interest, and return it with payment on-delivery.</p>
            
            <p>All Illusionists fall under the official Recovery Agent rank of the Xel Dynasty, similar to our own government. However, these hunters typcially remain out of the Dynasty's justice system; they are typically not bothered nor trifled with unless the Dynasty is forced to engage/react under military-government circumstances.</p>
